2024-03-14 21:13:53,"If your into anything action related or into games with quests or whatever, Genshin Is what I recommend. This game you have a whole obese map and you can explore everywhere and get teleport waypoints to always go to different areas and it's useful for quests so you can just teleport. The game is kind of like Zelda in my opinion. You can collect weapons and explore like I said and kill all kinds of monsters or bosses. You can also collect and level up characters by finding chests and making wishes. You can even upgrade your weapons and they thankfully don't break at all. The characters even have useful powers like fire or water, etc and are useful to use. And there's always updates to the game. And the graphics and animations are amazing. I wrote 4 stars though cause sometimes the game can be a little glitchy (rarely but still) and I feel there's a bit too much to it. I be having 15+ quests almost 24/7 and there's so many others they want me to find and add to the list of the fat amount of quests and there's a bunch of achievements you have to do adding to the quests. And sometimes it takes a long time to level up the character's. And idk sometimes it's too much to handle for me but all in all its a good game and I love it and it's good if your ok with plenty of jobs to do and to achieve useful items. 
I hope this helps to you earthlings (sorry for long explanation)",4,False,Paimon ‚ú®,Beautiful (also mid) üòå,
2024-03-12 23:53:32,"I‚Äôve been playing genshin off and on for years, at first I wasn‚Äôt much of a fan but I got back into it and i‚Äôm really enjoying it. I‚Äôm always left in awe at each cutscene, and each story quest and archon quest keeps me wanting to play for hours on end. I will say some aspects of the game or certain boss fights, mostly because of the amount of times I have to fight one boss without having a chance to go heal and having to fight the abyss herald so many times. Regardless the characters get even better with each patch and I always get excited when I hear a new character will be released. I have not so slowly but surely made genshin a part of my daily habits, weather thats a good thing for my productivity remains unanswered, but thats okay with me. I didn‚Äôt expect to become to invested with each story and lore, each character having ties to other characters, there own unique backstory's and play styles. Overall the game is breathtaking, the scenery is beyond beautiful and the puzzles all around Teyvat give me something to do when I‚Äôm procrastinating doing my world quests. The only issue I save with the game, which really isn't an issue, but more of a mechanic of sorts, I wish that there was a way to save wishes in a virtual wallet of sorts, somewhere to put them so that the temptation to spend them while saving up is less likely. Other than that, genshin has never failed, nor will it in the future I am sure to amaze me in every way.",5,False,Dreamercorngirl,Addiction unlocked‚úÖ,
2021-07-29 20:38:39,"this game is the best game I‚Äôve ever downloaded! it‚Äôs a great open word game, the plot is amazing and all the characters very well designed and have great backgrounds. i love all the fun things you can experience in this game like domains, bosses, and the wishing system (getting characters). and the system of daily commissions, and you‚Äôre reputation in different places to get wind gliders is super fun! also there‚Äôs gods that rule over the seven nations of Teyvet, and all the gods will eventually become playable characters, like Venti (anemo archon), Zhongli (geo archon), and Baal that will be coming soon (electro archon). also every nation has something special like Mondstat is the city of freedom, Liyue is the city of contracts, and Inazuma is the city of eternity and etc. some things are a little too complicated for me, for example building characters with artifacts, also artifacts help a lot with getting though with enemy‚Äôs faster (better dmg, def, hp.), but I just try my best. something I don‚Äôt understand is and I don‚Äôt like is that you can‚Äôt craft and unlock teleport waypoints and talk to people while in co-op mode. and I also love the new map, but I‚Äôm not so good at puzzles lol. also visions and all the elements, pyro, hydro, anemo, electro, dendro, cryo, geo. something I wanted added to the game is being able to pet animals, although it seems kinda silly I still think it‚Äôs cute. pls download this game its the best, enjoyy! ü§ç",5,False,‚ú®Paimon‚ú®,best game in the universe! <3,
2020-10-12 17:38:12,"I‚Äôm one of those people who Judges a game by its video/screenshots/price/platform rather than description so at first, I personally thought it was some copy or ripoff of another game that costs 60$ more that will be left unnamed, but it‚Äôs much different. There are some things I would love changes too like, you don‚Äôt start with so much stuff, you can have two to three characters out as an a.i. that you can switch to when you need them for a puzzle or you want to get them out of a predicament instead of having one out at a time and hear characters that may not be there, with that edition you could have a healer and strategize rather than switching to what you need when you need it out of nowhere. Another thing is that the gameplay and story through me off from how original and fun it was for a game I was initially going to play as a time waster. I would quiet enjoy to have more skins for your characters and voiced dialogue/more story into the main character instead of a random flying thing that always seems starved. I love the mystery so if you are into that sort of thing I think that you would like it although even with fast travel, travel is quiet annoying and unfortunately, I have no ideas for that

TL/DR: You should play because of story and animations if not because it‚Äôs free

2021-02-18 13:20:18,"This game is insane. I‚Äôve played now for a total of 42 days, according to HoyoLab. Easily hundreds of hours. I play every day for hours. This is the only game I'm currently investing time in. And let me say it is WORTH your time. A HUGE open world not pay to win and complete flexibility with how you play. I have invested around $20 total over the course of my time and it was for 1 character, Xiao. I didn't get him, however i did end up getting him with a free wish i received, go figure. But this is not like a normal GATCHA game. You get so many characters with the chance at more and more completely for free. You never have to spend money. There is no pay wall and the story lines are fantastic. I literally cant type out enough praise for this game. Its the best game i have played hands down in a very very long time. 
It does need some more end-game or late-game content, especially because at AR37 the story just stops. 
DEVS: This game is a huge accomplishment and you should all be proud. Its extremely ambitious, especially if you are planning on including zones that represent every element, however, keep with it. You guys can have THE best game of all time if you listen to your fan base and keep this momentum up! The lantern rite event was absolutely incredible! 
P.S. try and keep the tower defense mini game in! Its so much fun just to pass time! And it gives us a reason to keep playing after we finish our daily grind!",5,False,CraftiBadger,AAA Title for free,
2022-07-13 01:34:58,"Overall the game is great, but there are some major problems. While some QoL changes have been made since I last considered reviewing the game there is some new insight now that I‚Äôve spent a small amount of money on the game. Mostly, my biggest complaint is with the weapon banner wish. Even though they added a guarantee system, it‚Äôs still incredibly hard for smaller spenders to get the weapons they want. I won twice and got both of the ones I wanted but that‚Äôs incredibly rare and most people don‚Äôt have that sort of luck. I know they don‚Äôt take feedback very often, especially in such an oversaturated category, but I wish the Fate Points would carry over to the banners. It is still reasonably hard to get the correct weapon, but right now, I feel very discouraged from spending my money on the banner because if I don‚Äôt spend enough then all of it will go to waste.

I also have some concerns for how this game will conclude. I don‚Äôt think the system of adding so many new characters every single update is very sustainable. In HI3 each of them has different battlesuits but the characters are technically the same people, so the story is somewhat more streamlined. I also think a condensed resin/resin refresh rate/resin cap increase is overdue since Sumeru will probably come with many more weekly bosses.",5,False,Iris Jin,Love the game but I wish there were some minor changes,
2021-07-15 00:47:42,When I first started I had no idea how to play it would be nice if before you played there where instructions but idk if there where I didn‚Äôt actually read or remember so if there word my bad!!! But I had no idea how to play so I didn‚Äôt like it at first. Eventually I figured it out and went to the statue of the seven the first one they tell us to go too I thought it was pretty interesting since then. After wards I went to mondstant (idk how to spell it sorry) and that‚Äôs my favorite part bc I thought I would be alone in the game and that I would have to make camp fires and that but At the end there was a town where u can buy stuff and relax ‚Ä¶ etc witch is great!!! Therefore came the missions and at first I did all of them and defeat every enemy I saw but when I continued playing I started to avoid the fights because I just wanted to get to the target like if it was a walk in the part but the coding in genshin made it very hard meaning that it was nearly imposible to not be attacked by enemy‚Äôs but even so I did avoid the enemy‚Äôs . But I came to realize if I fight more enemy‚Äôs I get leveled up! So that‚Äôs great I avoid but also fight sometimes. Right now currently having a hard time with the mountains it‚Äôs pretty hard to stay warm and idk how to pass the mission it‚Äôs called ‚Äúlost in the snow‚Äù. - but overall I loved the game it makes me feel all sorts of emotions!!!!,5,False,<3 traveler,Worth the hard work!!!,
2023-04-07 00:52:39,"i‚Äôve been playing genshin for over 2 years and it‚Äôs my current hyperfixiation at the moment. i play it A LOT and never have many issues with the game, even though i play almost always on mobile. i‚Äôve played on pc recently and i can say that the iphone and pc graphics are almost the same quality. my overall positive opinion(s) on the game is the story line is absolutely amazing and so so interesting, especially all the lore involved, i also love all the characters designs and how cute they all look, and many characters keep coming out and getting leaked and they all look great. i also love how it‚Äôs open world and there are many different things to do and opportunities to experience while exploring and such! on the other hand, some downsides are that higher ranked players, like about ar 45-60, have little to no chances to do anything but dailies and farm bosses plus domains, and just do events that come out every now and then. i would very highly recommend that there are more things to do and more opportunities for higher ar players to be able to do things other then log on, do dailies, look at characters, and then log off. it gets super boring after awhile, so maybe add some more events and activity‚Äôs. other then that i plan to play the game till i‚Äôm ar 60 or i own all the characters. thanks hoyoverse for the great game :)",4,False,alfredoü¶¶,"great game, my current hyperfixiation, could be better",
2022-03-13 01:36:26,"Overall, Genshin Impact was a pretty cool game at the beginning. Including the immaculate amount of high quality graphics and the absolutely adorable designs, such as Paimon. Although, after at least 30 minutes, I believe, of downloading the full version, following Amber and completing quests, all the way to discovering the temple and fighting the monsters, I had uncovered a level where you had to fly to reach the other side. You were stuck on a huge cliff, on one side, a huge gap in the middle, and the other side. The instructions that Amber had given me were to fly across the gap to get to the other side. After all, I had just discovered the game ability to fly a while ago. Thinking this was easy, I concentratedly pressed the button and attempted to fly across the gorge, only to be sent down into the ""abyss"" and be revived. Just then I had discovered that your characters could die, unfortunately. I repeatedly tried over and over to fly across the gorge without the game automatically making my character sink in a sort of slow matter, enough time to make me fail to reach the other side. My lives were decreasing and soon enough, the only character left I could use was Amber. Eventually I just gave up. Developer, do you think you could possibly consider this problem that I, a mobile player, have been having? I cannot play Genshin Impact until the ""glitch"" has been fixed, since my lives are decreasing every try. Sincerely, -An Upset Player.",3,False,lucyismypuppysname:),Stuck.,
2021-12-17 05:03:45,"As a heavy genshin daily player, I‚Äôd like to say that this is the most fun game I had in quite some time. The character designs are great, the voice lines are great, and the graphics are truest stunning (playing on a pc/ iPhone 13 pro). However, this game does come with several flaws. First of all, let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room. Please improve your resin system. With more content than ever, we players need more resin than ever. Please increase resin tick/gain speed to 5 min per, and increase resin cap to 200. This would help a lot. Furthermore, the content in this game is kinda drying out. I‚Äôve done all the quests there are and it gets boring after some time. The only thing left to do is to farm for talent up materials or artifacts, which relies on RESIN. Additionally, you should improve your daily commission system, an improvement towards the expedition system where it's auto or a resend button would be nice. I'd also like to suggest having an expedition where you could get primogemms,, but have a chance of failing to get them. Please also buff certain characters such as yoimiya, Kokomi, these 5* are overshadowed by other characters. Bennet should be nerfed, as he single handedly can care an entire abyss team. Make his healing stop at 60% and reduce his attack buff. Also buff qiqi and keqing. Your character balance is needed more than ever",5,False,Grace7879,"Great game, needs some fixing tho",
2024-02-05 03:36:41,"So basically, a lot of people are mad that hoyo is giving out a free 5 star and giving special rewards to Honkai players and not Genshin players. I think those complains are people being dramatic. Honestly, the rewards system has nothing to do with the gameplay itself. If you're playing the game just for the rewards, then that's probably the reason you're complaining. Why not just enjoy the game without all the rewards? If you're gonna rate it 1 star just because of the rewards then that's kinda stupid. 
 Now let me talk about the gameplay itself. I personally think Genshin is an amazing game because it's an open world game with a gacha system and so much more. Also, please don't complain about it taking up your storage. At least you got it on mobile, right? Anyways, I really love the game and the characters. The character designs are so pretty and majestic, just looking at them makes me happy. 
For all the people saying Genshin copied breath of the wild, they're actually really different, though they do have some similarities.
The storyline for genshin is amazing! The lore is also really good and I just genuinely like the idea of the archons. There are also so many likable characters. 
In conclusion, Genshin is an amazing game, and you need to download it, either on here, on your computer, or anything else. JUST GET IT TRUST ME!",5,False,Maplebearfromcc,I'm writing an honest review here,
2024-02-29 22:40:41,"I just want it to be known first I DO NOT ever write reviews on any app that I have ever used. There is a reason I‚Äôm taking my time right now to make one about Genshin Impact. I have always been an Xbox X player, a little bit of PC as well. But after many years of playing on Xbox I became really interested in mobile gaming. And feel like it‚Äôs a little underrated. Like people aren‚Äôt totally crazy for mobile gaming. However, Genshin Impact I feel you guys poured heart & soul into it. The ambient sounds, the comforting music, that nostalgic feel I‚Äôm getting from I‚Äôm not sure what because I have never really watched any type of anime. But also the variety of things to be done, the character selection. Let‚Äôs not forget the amazing capabilities! Currently playing on my iPhone 15 plus, and it runs amazing! Although almost all settings are on high, if I try to run at 60fps it says it‚Äôs to much to handle. Despite that, the fact that I can play this with an Xbox controller and then screen mirror to my 55‚Äù Samsung 4kUHD TV makes the gaming experience so much more enjoyable and fun to play! I just downloaded this game last night and I can already tell I‚Äôm going to have such a good time. It‚Äôs also a mental thing for me, very calming and relaxing to play. Hopefully this review will be recognized because if I could, this IMO deserves 10/10 star rating.",5,False,BSquadKilla,Absolutely blown away,
2023-07-18 09:18:08,"Ok,I started the game on I think July 1 or 3 and already it‚Äôs my favorite game! I love how beautiful the art is and the characters are sooo cute! Personally my favorite characters are venti,xianling,and Lisa I love they‚Äôre personalities and the way they look they‚Äôre sooo cute I‚Äôm currently on level 18 and I also love how you can either join a multiplayer server or a single player server as a person who doesn‚Äôt like multiplayer games bc idk i have social anxiety but I think the real reason is that I get paranoid about what people think about me or what they‚Äôre saying üòÇ the only down fall just for me is that- IM STUPID and some of the quests are a little hard like the abyss mage one I don‚Äôt wanna spoil what happens in it but they‚Äôre kinda hard but on the bright side i did say I get paranoid but it not just about what ppl are saying about me but I also get paranoid about bad things happening to either my friends or family like A-LOT or me so if that ever happens I play this game and I feel better it‚Äôs just a feel good game! So yeah I would totally recommend the game if your 12+ like the game says you should totally get it or if it‚Äôs ok with your guardian and your underage and you get the game don‚Äôt worry about what it says in the reasons on why it‚Äôs 12+ I think it‚Äôs because of some of the outfits and the violence!

2021-12-05 03:38:38,"Before this game my life was a barren wasteland of‚Ä¶ well crap.. it was crap most definitely crap. Then one evening while talking to a friend on discord they happen to be streaming it, I was like ‚Äúheyyy whatcha playin‚Äô there??‚Äù Thus Genshin Impact was downloaded onto my phone. Now.. at first I was like, ‚Äúthis game is kinda hard‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kinda strange‚Äù, but.. as time progressed I got more and more interested in the stories, quests, themes etc. Then a couple months into playing Eula happened, I was awestruck, I was mesmerized, I was completely hypnotized by that blue hair and oh so thique thighs she has. But what captured my attention more than her character design, was her impeccable swordsmanship. The way she swings her claymore with such grace and beauty just.. *Mwuah* magnifique! Now lemme tell ya I dumped a little over $300 on her. I ended up pulling Diluc before her sadly losing my 50/50 but it was all worth it once I got her in my party. I will add as a final touch to this review, that Genshin Impact has saved me from lots of depression, this game makes me feel good, takes my mind out of the dark and brings me such joy I cannot describe it through words alone. For that I thank you Mihoyo, you‚Äôve helped me, and you‚Äôve helped thousands of other chronically depressed teens who are probably failing school as well just like me.

2021-05-25 15:18:10,"This game is great overall but I think it needs a bit of customization like a character creator where you can make your own character when you go into it you need to pay 2 primo gems to make your own character and it will also ask if you want your own animations and moves witch cost 10 primo gems you can choose yes or no when you get into the character creator it will ask if you want a male, female or a small female after selecting it will ask your characters name when after you Type it in it will show step one the eyes you will be able to customize the eyelashes eye color and eye shape and eye size after that step 2 is mouth you will be able to choose from cat mouth normal mouth and squiggly mouth and lipstick step 3 is hair you will be able to choose bangs side bangs back hair and ponytails and colors step4 will be what type of character you want a cat like diona a elf or a human step5 will be to choose your skin color step6 will be for the ones who payed the primo gems for custom animations and moves if your on a pc you can upload your own animations and moves after all of that you will chose your weapon, hat, glasses, hoodie, top, skirt, socks and dress if you want you can change your character for free later on that‚Äôs all I got to say as I said overall the game is good but it needs customization thanks if you put this in the game.",4,False,cute pun pun 2,It‚Äôs great but it needs more customization.,
2020-12-29 06:06:11,"I have played this game since its release, and so far, I still think it‚Äôs a good game. I really love the beautiful graphics and characters! The storyline and the voice acting is great, too. I also enjoy doing the events! I love the Co-op feature; it‚Äôs more fun to play with other players. As an F2P, I can assure you that with enough patience and grinding, you will do fine. It‚Äôs a self-paced game, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about trying to catch up with other players. Alright, now that I have said the pros, here are the cons of this game: the gacha rates, how little primogems we earn, and the grinding. It‚Äôs hard to get a five-star character. I get that, but after maybe like 4-5 x10 pulls and only getting duplicate characters & weapons? It‚Äôs hard to earn primogems to begin with, and the gacha rates does not make too happy about it. Like I said, it is also hard to earn primogems since you earn little by little each day. I‚Äôm not complaining too much about the grinding, but I will just tell you that it gets harder and harder as you level your characters up. In doing so, you must have a lot of patience and time. All-in-all, this game is pretty good despite some flaws here and there. I understand that the developer needs to make money, hence the pretty low gacha rates.

2020-11-14 08:30:09,"So at first I was going to play this on PC, yet my computer is pretty slow and this game doesn‚Äôt work very well on it, so I usually play in my phone. So far I‚Äôm at Adventure Rank 27, and I‚Äôve had almost no problems with the game. The storyline is great and there‚Äôs almost always something to do whether it‚Äôs the main story, side quests, daily commissions, or just exploring. The one thing that‚Äôs bad about this, as I‚Äôve seen mentioned a lot before, is the resin system. The resin is the main part of the game that helps you level faster, but it regenerates at 1 per 8 minutes with a limit of 120. This can lead to a boring hour of just wandering and waiting for the resin to regenerate. Now onto the effect it has on my device. I‚Äôve seen others say that it heats up your device pretty quickly, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs only a tiny bit faster at heating your device up as other games are.

Now let me say I NEVER write reviews but this game blew my mind. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the lack of changing clothes option you would think with all these options and customizational paths you would be able to at least change your clothes or your hair it would be so cool if you could change clothes or even your hair!! Like you could cut it or make it longer or different hairstyles things like that of course you would have to pay for the clothes and getting your hair done. I don‚Äôt think you should be able to change your hair color though since you are looking for someone that looks like you so being a whole different color of hair wouldn‚Äôt really match the description. So yeah you don‚Äôt have to come to the hair thing super quickly just start off with a clothing store in Mondstadt and I notice they mention they know you are not from around there when they see or mention your clothes so make different clothing in different stores but accustomed to the city. But start off small and just continue updating the game I think it would add a whole other aspect to the game making it even more fun than it already is! I know it would for me!!

2021-10-01 03:04:27,"This is a wonderful RPG with like-able characters who have great abilities. I stopped playing this game because it was too expensive! I pulled 2 5-star weapons other than the one I wanted. I was guaranteed to get Baal's weapon the next time I pulled a 5-star weapon, but at what cost? I spent so much money to pull for a weapon that I never got. The only 5-star character I enjoyed is Eula. But it took weeks or maybe months to get decent artifacts. Even if you don't spend money I think you will be disappointed because the rewards aren't worth the amount of time it takes to earn them. I think that it should a little easier to pull 5 stars and decent artifacts. I also think the daily commission rewards should slightly increase with a players Adventure Rank. I don't think getting rewards should be easy but I shouldn't feel like I am playing the lottery either. 

I think there should be reruns for popular characters like Venti, Xiao, and Hu-Tao. A separate banner that changes periodically for past banners would be great. There are so many players who are saving primogems for characters in previous banners. It's disappointing when you play a character's story quest, get to use the characters on trial and then thats it.

The reason I felt pushed to write this is because recently changed servers and started from the beginning. I had forgotten how no matter what kind of games you like Genshin will always have something for you to do. There are so many quests and things to grind. And if you don‚Äôt like grinding there‚Äôs stuff for you too. There‚Äôs so much diversity in gameplay, so many characters, and so many different places to explore. I have at least two friends who only play to take pictures of the sunsets in game for desktop backgrounds (it hysterical to watch and listen to them talk about ‚Äúfinding the perfect angle‚Äù or ‚Äúexactly which side the sun should be on‚Äù). Plus I myself have become a completely different person because of Genshin. Seeing all of these characters being themselves, and not caring about the public eye, fictional or not, made me feel more confident in myself.

Upgrading characters and weapons is already hard as it is, like getting something from a boss and it taking it forever to get the boss gone. Getting materials is so hard I can‚Äôt even level up without having the mobs being a higher lvl than me. Second, it‚Äôs so hard to do a story and world quest because all the jobs to get rid of the mobs are hard because they‚Äôre a higher lvl, like I can‚Äôt even finish one story quest or even archon quest without having to quit them because they‚Äôre just that hard, and it takes the fun out of it.

No matter how beautiful the art and soundtrack it needs to have good plot and gameplay to succeed. And I can say that this game does have that.

Even though mobile commonly has problems like mistapping and sometimes an annoying movement system they haven‚Äôt shown up enough to damper my opinion of it.

Also the grinding system of loot and resin gives the player a reason to come back. 
There are a couple problems of course such as low drop rates for artifacts and characters but that‚Äôs how gatcha games are. Also since it‚Äôs open world it takes up a LOT of space and memory.

That said, I gave this game four stars. The reason for this isn‚Äôt because of some minor glitches that allow items to just float in midair (like what happened to me lol), but because of overheating issues on my IPhone SE Second Generation and the amount of battery life it siphons compared to some of my other apps.

It has simple mechanics and interface, meaning that even if you don‚Äôt normally play video games, you can still pick up on what to do pretty quickly. There is plenty of content for you to do when you *first* start. Will keep you entertained for hours, days, weeks, months, maybe years.

 Cons: you get burnt out a while after finishing the storyline and some farming for your characters. Artifact system has WAY too much RNG which is one of if not the system that burns players out most. Events are limited and once they go away, the important lore (and rewards) go away as well. Endgame is basically nonexistent. Little to no interaction with playerbase; company is very greedy. Extremely expensive (although that‚Äôs not a surprise). Characters are region locked, making Inazuman (and potentially others) characters inaccessible to new players who might have obtained them.

All the different quests can give you rewards from large amounts of primogems (the items used for getting different characters and weapons) to mora (the currency in the game) and exp books. The characters in Genshin are also amazing, from their design to play style and lore there is so much to learn about them. Like the traveler that you play as, the differences between them (I used them because you pick between Aether, the boy and Lumine, the girl).

On the other hand tho, as you‚Äôve already seen from the other reviews and considering your 4.4 star rating (which will likely change depending on your next anniversary rewards), you most definitely have to bump up the amount of rewards we receive, especially Primogems.

I pay into this game a lot so i personally don't care but for f2p and low spenders it makes it incredibly hard to get good units, including 5 stars and sig weapons. Other than that I love this game. I've been playing for almost a year and i do not regret it.

Another thing is that if you don‚Äôt update the game you can‚Äôt play at all, it locks you out until you have enough room to update because most of the updates are story based and keep you moving on in the game.

There are many puzzles to solves, getting surprised with the weird locations at which they place treasure chests, and world quests with great backstories. The backstories are also well written, many providing players with reasons to look back and experience it again. I really have to give the designers of the characters a hands down, the designs are top notch. The voice actors are chosen well and the background of the characters really breathes life into them. There are many reasons to love (or hate in some cases üòÇ) each character. The fighting mechanisms should be relatively easy for players to get used to.

Overall I probably wouldn‚Äôt change much about the game except I would make the drops a bit richer and I would improve the teapot editor. It can be very frustrating especially when you are dealing with floating elements. Also a lock feature would be helpful. I haven‚Äôt done much in the way of events yet, but hoping to do more.

So I downloaded this game because I‚Äôd heard and seen so many good things about it. The graphics, open world and storyline are absolutely stunning. But the storyline came at a huge time expense.

And believe me when I say the leveling system is slower than cold molasses. It took me literally 3 weeks of clearing daily quests and side quests before I could finish chapter 2. And another 4 weeks before I could finish chapter 3. Then there‚Äôs the issue of the character and weapon enhancing system. After a certain point weapons and characters need special items in order to continue advancing in power. Well let me tell you after searching and unlocking the current entire map (at the time anyway) and trading with people and crafting and going to the in game shops that exchanged special items for the items you needed I could not get my characters/weapons to progress any further to the point where I kept dying every 2 seconds.

It‚Äôs difficult to get 90 pity in 1 banner and to just loose my 50/50 to another 5 star, it hurts and I‚Äôm pretty sure other people who really want their dream character can relate. The second problem is the character designs, in my opinion I think we need more plus-sized and darker skin tone characters and sometimes I feel like the designs are stereotypical! Im really tired of mihoyo just having one different design and then they change it for something that they‚Äôre not and I‚Äôve heard a lot of people saying ganyus og design was plus-size and you changed it. Third problem is sometimes when your adventure rank is higher the quests get WAYYY harder then they need to! Kinda the dragonspine quest and a lot of inazuma quests and boss fights.

The problem lies more in storage and in how much the game can offer to those who don‚Äôt spend a dime on gacha. Storage for the game is close, if not, almost impossible to achieve for the majority of players.

As for the game not being that F2P friendly, I do spend money on the game so this isn‚Äôt really coming out from my point of view, but I will repeat what others have said.. with exploration, commissions, quests, etc, the game usually only gives enough to guarantee 2-3 of the highest rarity characters. Yes while players could save up, there are others who once they skip the character, would have to wait a long while for a rerun (For example: the character Ms Eula).

2021-06-30 16:32:39,I know this game is fairly new so I hope they fix this soon. This game is an amazingly fun open world experience and at the beginning and there is so much to do. But when you get to a certain point you sort of run out of things to do and you find yourself in a tedious repetition of just doing your daily commissions etc. at the ar 40 and up stage. It gets too easy in open world to the point where you are two shotting the bosses. The game encourages you to get stronger when there is no point to get stronger because you can already beat the games content. Another thing is the gap between f2p and p2w. Neither are better or worse but there is a substantial difference between the two. It costs about $300! To get 1 5 star! That‚Äôs outrageous and totally not worth it. We do need whales in the community to support the company but it‚Äôs like $20 for like 7 summons. Thankfully the game has added a lot of new content in the newest patch and those that will follow so there will be content. The biggest problem is the power creeps.

Therefor, the file size is going to be quite large. I think like, 8gbs for me currently? It being a full game on mobile also means that the controls can be difficult. I‚Äôm fine with them now, but it took a while. 
Second, keep in mind that mihoyo would like money for this game. It‚Äôs f2p, but that does come with the drawbacks of less and lower quality characters and equipment. But I play the game the explore, follow quest lines, and kind of just chill. If you‚Äôre expecting something special/new every time you play, you‚Äôll have to spend money. 
For a free game with a million things to do/ focus on/ explore, I‚Äôve had a ton of fun and been overwhelmingly impressed.

Every time i finished online school I would go straight to genshin because of how fun it is. But there are pros and cons. Let me start with the pros. The first thing is, that we have an open world and can explore. And we get primogems just for exploring teyvat. Sometimes when we finish some events we a get free character or primogems. Which can be used for wishing/resin. Same thing with quests. Now for the cons, the first thing I especially want to talk about is the difficulty for the quests. Some of the quests can be so confusing and so hard for no reason? The first 3 nations quest were easy. But, when the chasm came out. The difficulty when up and up. Which makes things for players difficult. And sometimes have to search up tutorials because on how hard it is. Sumeru and the chasm are hard quests. And I‚Äôm still stuck in the chasm because of how hard it is. I‚Äôm not saying to make all the quests easy, I‚Äôm just saying to make it less difficult for new players or players that are coming back to the game. Thank you.

Big but though, what is the point of farming and grinding when we have nothing to test our artifacts/abilities?

After that you will be consistently doing daily commissions and using all of your resin day by day which gets boring real fast. The events sometimes are fun but they are really hit or miss.

2022-06-13 05:18:07,"Honestly this is one of my favorite games. However I feel like there are just a couple of things that would make the overall gameplay experience a little bit better and truly get that last star for me. First day I feel like the every day bosses are too expensive to farm when compared to the need to farm other resources like talent books artifacts and weekly bosses. 
In my opinion what should be done here would be to negate the cost of every day bosses so that they‚Äôre easier to form and don‚Äôt require resin. The other thing I feel is it the wish system is also too expensive for F2P players. Most gotcha games that I‚Äôve played are not  as expensive and I find that this fact really discourages me from wishing unless I really have to. Also the whole 50-50 system and the potential to lose to another unwanted 5 star again turns me off form wishing it‚Äôs always nerve-racking to wish for thise special characters. 
I think two things here would be beneficial one if you wish and get a five star your first five star should be a character on the banner I also think that wishing costs should be cut down to 75 primo gems rather than the normal 150 I think this would promote more wishing and more opportunities to get a character",4,False,Frozenhero1996,I love the game but‚Ä¶,

My biggest complaint is the resource intensity, you have a team of 4 characters, you can only get their level-up-resources on certain days, and you can only dungeon run so many times a day (due to resin).  If your whole team needs the same day, it can be really difficult. And if you‚Äôre say level 50, and you get a new character, you have to get all those resources and enough in-game-currency to level up that new character before you can play it, cause if they get attacked by a level 55 monster (which is perfect for your over all level), and they‚Äôre only like level 5, they‚Äôre going to die.

However, once you finish all the story quests there's nothing left to grind until they make another update. It then gets really boring and frustrating to wait for the banner you want and getting primogems is impossibly hard as it requires over 10k primos for 1 5* while each day you get 60 per commission and with the chance of not getting the character you want means you have to grind months just for one character. Higher ranks take forever to get, and they rarely give out interwined fates, or primogems, they only give us wishes for the standard banner when you level up. Nonetheless, it's a very enjoyable game when you first start but gets really demotivating, and without spending money getting anything you want may take months of patience, which I can say I don't have. I'd love for event reruns, or make them permanent like the Scaramouche one. And adding more gears and small co-op minigames like the hide and seek one.

However, with the many perks there are slight problems. For example the farming for artifacts, characters, talents, or even weapons can be exhausting if you play often. it can become repetitive and while some people enjoy that, many people(such as myself) can get very bored or frustrated.

more specifically with their upcoming region, sumeru. with the recent livestream showing off their architecture for sumeru, that is based off south asia and north africa, there are NO dark-skinned nps OR characters to be coming out from leaks , which proves that the game‚Äôs company do not care about them offending and disrespecting the real life people from the places they are basing their games‚Äô regions off of. the characters that we are aware of from leaks are seen to be EXTREMELY orientalist & islamphobic and goes to show that the company has no remorse for those they are profiting off of.

i‚Äôve been an active player for over a year, have given this game my own money , and for this misrepresentation to come out of this with no regards or apology or change from the company, it tells us as players that the company does not care about our concerns and judgements. it is very disappointing, but i will no longer be publicly or financially supporting this game until there are changes made and i hope others do the same",1,False,hazzassidehow,lack of proper representation,

update: i‚Äôve played for three years.. i‚Äôve spent more than $20. my opinion is still the same, AR 50-60 will be tedious for f2p or any player, it doesn‚Äôt have to revolve around $. for new players, genshin will have more content than when it launched. for old players, its just a filler patch and waiting for new 5*s, 4*s, etc. at least that‚Äôs how it feels to me and at the end of the day it‚Äôs just my opinion. as an older player, i‚Äôve taken breaks from the game, i still come back cause i feel nostalgic, but it‚Äôs not that enjoyable anymore. i‚Äôd like to see mihoyo add real ‚Äúendgame content‚Äù because the content we have now is limited to events, TGC (a card and dice game), and abyss.",3,False,Flawless__,minor issues!,

It‚Äôs an open world exploration game so there‚Äôs lots of stuff to do. 
HOWEVER: just a quick heads up, this game comes with lots of updates as it‚Äôs an ongoing game that‚Äôs adding onto its story and game as we go. This means that it will take a good chunk of memory and that the whole map, story, and cast of characters isn‚Äôt released yet. 
Yes, there is a gacha system where you wish for more characters, but it‚Äôs not unfair to free to play players. I‚Äôm free to play and I‚Äôve gotten good characters (and even a five star one!) so you don‚Äôt need money to enjoy it.

The quests that you can do are also amazing, following one archon quest that follows the story of the traveler (you) and involved the intricate stories of each person there, and of the tales and creation of the 7 archons in Teyvat. The thought and creation put into each character and their voice lines and story is truly amazing, and each part of that adds to the interactiveness and the beauty of the game.

This game is based off luck, sure but not everyone is lucky, especially me. If the gacha system works as it says to work, a player shouldn't have to reach full pity to get a single 5* character. I am also F2P so i have to miss atleast 2 banners to get a 5* that isn't even guaranteed. The new weapon system isn't even circling around F2P either, only for people who bring you money. With the events which only give you 430 primos each event, a player doesn't even get a 10 pull unless they spend zero primos for a MONTH straight. A little bit over an entire banner. Also, why does this game break so often? Every polearm in the game can get stuck on something small like a boulder in the open world.

Some character abilities work very inconsistently (ex: Xinyan's tier 3 shield and Sara's teleport both don't work as intended, both have been issues since the characters were released and have yet to be acknowledged), but only bugs that are useful or entertaining for the player get fixed (ex: Kokomi's walking on water infinitely, a fun bug that makes exploring more fun and which MiHoYo has announced plans to fix immediately, when other characters like the ones I just mentioned have literally broken abilities and MiHoYo doesn't care).

There's very little transparency with MiHoYo. They tell players basically nothing and do everything they can to sweep player complaints under the rug.

Especially with the recent decisions made by MiHoYo to be stingy with anniversary rewards, especially the meager community event rewards that are locked behind RNG and nowhere near proportional to the work many content creators put in, I can't in good faith recommend this game to anyone.

Each of these little details just makes the game more enjoyable and unique compared to other gacha games. Like have you ever seen a gacha game this massive?

Just get more storage or don‚Äôt get the game. No need to falsely rate the game without playing it. In conclusion, I really like Genshin Impact and it is an amazing game with cool mechanics.

I like to join my friends and play together, the story of the game is also very interesting and nice. If you haven‚Äôt tried it out, you definitely should. The community has a lot of funny jokes, and are very nice, although some can be very rude or toxic. So this game is a really good game if you want a fun open-world exploring Gacha game. But, This game does not give out much rewards and there aren‚Äôt a lot of options to get the in-game Gacha currency Primo gems.  This game is free, but you will probably spend money since it is hard to get Primo gems, and if you can‚Äôt afford spending money on a game, it‚Äôs pretty hard to get good characters and weapons from the Gacha. I feel like this game should include more ways of getting Primo gems. Another thing I don‚Äôt like about this game is that if you have played for a long time and finished most of the quests, explored a lot, and leveled up a lot, then you have nothing to do.

Finding gear for your character is random, but with it comes a great feeling when you finally get the one you want. The world is gorgeous and filled up with things to grab/fight! I give the game 4 stars because the resin/primogem system rewards you with a ton of items at the start, but takes that level of reward away over time like a shady drug dealer. The rates for characters are awful given the price point for a shot at them, especially after you‚Äôve spent money on the one time bonus gems packs. The more they add characters, the less likely you get the one that would fit perfectly in your team so that leaves me worried about the future of the game.

This game is AMAZING, its a beautiful step into the gacha part of video games, and this game is absolutely beautiful, from the story line to the amazing graphic designs, but, there are many things that i feel must be discussed. Primogems. Primogems are a reward and common to get, but i wouldnt say their easy to get, you get them during events, from chests, in mail, and more, but these gems will mean A LOT more than they seem. Which comes up to the next thing, wishing. You need primogems to wish and this where a HUMONGOUS PROBLEM erupts with players in this game. There have been many banners with characters to wish for, and if your a desperate player with no primogems, you start to get more and more desperate for primos the shorter the time for a character, leading them to buy, buy, buy away, using their money to buy primogems just for a character they love, which can lead to much more than you would think. 

To the devs: this is an amazing game, and i have nothing to complain about, and im sure you‚Äôve got this a lot, but i feel that if you added more generosity for primos and mora the experience would be better :)

You don‚Äôt have to throw money at it but you can be rewarded for everything in the game which is slower. But the real reason for this review is the combat.. it‚Äôs amazing! Four party members to rotate in combat and different elements to play mix and match with. You can go for pyro-electro for explosions for massive AOE damage. There is an element to every character and they transfer to the next chosen character in battle. The targeting is pretty spot on to. Most games have this weird tap to cycle target but this one doesn‚Äôt. It lets you do everything on your own. The biggest con that this game has to begin with is grouping with your friends. The game doesn‚Äôt allow you to group till adventure level 15 (not character level 15). When you are able to get with your friends man it is so much fun cause the mix and match of elements is pretty crazy for the amount of things going on in the background.

First, about monetization, it is absolutely fine to expect making a lot of money from this game consider the development cost and everything. However, one thing this game does not differ from many other Chinese games is a hard effort cap in gaining characters. I have played effortlessly on gaining in-game currencies but I would say it at maximum gives one draw each hour of gameplay. With a 0.6% chance, you barely gain any 5 star characters by only playing. Before the game launches, I was honestly expecting to see more monetization options on skins and other customizations, instead of on characters.
Second, about protagonist gameplay, personally I would like the protagonist ‚Äútraveler‚Äù to have more weapon options, the ability to wield two elements at the same time, and cross-element skills.

Throughout the game you can collect a secondary currency known as primogems and the amount you get is negligible. It takes hundreds of chests to just get one 10 summon. And they are a one time only find. The events do not give you enough to even guarantee you get a 5 star in general let alone the actual banner character itself. Even during their lantern rite festival which is meant to be a time of thanks for the support. We are given a single 10 pull. And they really stuck it when they offered the Chinese players 3 intertwined fates (the currency used to summon characters) bare in mind you need 90 to guarantee a 5 star character 50% of which can get you the banner character. The team behind this game does not care about community feedback let alone respects or appreciates the players. 10 pulls for global. And an additional 3 for the Chinese players is just ridiculous and honestly disrespectful. If they were to just say 10 summons and quality of life changes and end game.

The sad part is people are spending thousands of dollars to get these characters and the developers know the low rates bring profits. They‚Äôve figured out that people will pay massive amounts of cash to win, even if the rates are nearly impossible. People will literally spend themselves into debt to get these characters. Developers know this and take full advantage of it. 

The developers constantly ignore player feedback and don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks. Imagine paying a PS5 for each 5* character you want. That‚Äôs how much people shell out per character.

However, as someone who made it well into the endgame, the late game grind / gameplay balance is just not worth it. A full patch (6 weeks or so) of daily grinding / mediocre story content and full participation in the mediocre events is very mentally taxing, all for a small chance to get the next new character on the next banner (which is where most of the new gameplay / fun comes from). This is coming from someone who did buy the battle pass and welkin blessing, which made the wait slightly more rewarding. While I don‚Äôt regret spending the money I did, I find the end game experience pretty disappointing, and it did not seem worth the enormous grind.",4,False,ShrikeN5,Love Hate,

2020-10-24 19:38:35,"First, let me just say this game is absolutely fantastic and fun to play...for a week or so. Once you hit around Adventure Rank 30 you will become gated so hard by the resin (energy) system that you can only play for 30-60min a day with meaningful progression. Resin refreshes at a rate of 1/8min so you can regenerate 180 resin per day. All content that you need to grind (Mora [in game currency], character exp, weapon enhancement mats, skill enhancement books, world bosses, weekly bosses, equipment dungeons, etc) costs 20-60 resin each! Be careful spending money in this game because they have cleverly hidden this restriction since you can play an unlimited amount through exploring the map in the early game. It will not become apparent how painfully limiting this energy system is until you have finished the current main storyline (AR30). If you are an extremely casual player who can only play an hour a day, then yes you will be able to enjoy the game for quite some time. But if you are gamer that loves to progress as much as possible and level up all your characters then you will hit a brick wall. Even if you spend money to refresh your resin, your money will only net you a few extra minutes of playtime. One star until the devs fix their energy system and actually allow people to play their game without having to spend hundreds of $$$.

In the beginning leveling up was easy but now in the later game becomes a lot trickier to get the materials to level up your characters. So if you don‚Äôt like grinding and fighting bosses over and over again maybe don‚Äôt download it.

When you are lower you seem to have so much to do, but when you‚Äôre higher it‚Äôs like all you can do is sit there and wait a month or two for a ‚Äúnew‚Äù event to come out which has similar mechanics to older, previous events but just with some new story line that is hardly entertaining. Inazuma‚Äôs story pales in comparison to Mond and Liyue. Raiden was a decent villain, but her redemption was rushed and almost felt like they wanted us to sympathize with her just so that they could sell her off to us in the gacha. Also, as a mobile user I sometimes have issues with turning the screen. I am not sure if this is my phone‚Äôs fault or if it‚Äôs the game. But it refuses to turn sometimes when I am fighting.

Let‚Äôs start out with #1. When a player gets Co - op mode and everyone seems fine at first but then as your progress your unable to play with other people, and we get very confused then we figure out we must do quests to play Co - Op. The thing is, the second quest bugs everyone on mobile and or who have Lumine. ‚ÄúTrails in Tianqu‚Äù is the quest needed to complete  in order to be able to play with people again, for me it‚Äôs impossible to come Pete this quest because I‚Äôm on mobile and I also have lumine and in order to complete the time challege you need a geo character which I have only noelle.

The characters, the characters when you are playing them are very high quality but when your talking to them through dialogue there is no details the cloths are basically painted on there skin but when you are in a normal fight your characters, your teammates characters and the monster are perfectly detailed so that does bug me a lot

I know that not all of the people there are of darker skin. But it goes the other way around as well. Not all of the people there are paper color. There should be a good balance with a slight bias towards darker skinned characters. And the archon should definitely be darker skinned. Also with characters that are carrying names that are significant in those cultures, they should have some resemblance to the person who‚Äôs name they are taking on. It‚Äôs just a blatant disrespect and disregard towards people of that culture, as well as the historical figures that they are using as a guideline for the characters.

First, I recommend playing this game on a computer if possible, but if you find this circumstance that you only have a mobile device or are only willing to download on mobile, this is for you.

But for this game, If it says you don‚Äôt have enough storage for Regular Genshin which is about 2 GB, I would say have atleast 20GB. You can judge from there about how much space you need. Genshin is sometimes glitchy and it takes 20GB+ but sometimes takes 2GB. Although please don‚Äôt take any of this to be official. Circumstances may vary against others but from what I‚Äôve heard, others also have Genshin eating up their storage just like me.

Also for the entirety of Sumeru which is supposed to be based the Middle East, South Asia, and Northern Africa, there are hardly any npc‚Äôs that are people of color and even few playable characters. And considering how much effort they normally put in to portraying different culture with the accuracy they deserve, they fall extremely short when they portrayed Sumeru. Also their gambling system is awful, poor rates of actually getting the five star featured on the banner, this would be forgivable if you were able to earn more primo gems in a free way; but with the current system set up as a free to play player you have to save for at least three months to get the character you want, if you want two different characters who have banners close to each other you either buy primo gems or have extremely good luck.

Not only do you get to do your own thing, such as procrastinate from doing a quest you cant get passed. I know lots of other games wont allow that & you MUST complete the main quests to be able to do other things. However, Genshin Impact does not do this, instead they just let you go hunt for treasure chests to level up, (it‚Äôd take longer to level up if you just do that). The game is absolutely F2P friendly. The downside of this is that ‚ÄúCo-Op‚Äù the resources and work you‚Äôve done in another player‚Äôs world does not TRANSFER over to your own world. That is such a bummer since me and my friends enjoy going on adventures together.

Most of the 5 star characters are very OP, but because they‚Äôre 5 stars, they are harder to get. That means that you have to farm Primogems (a currency for wishing) all of the time to save up enough just for a 5 star character that you might not have even wanted (because there is a 50% chance that you get another character) I know a lot of people wrote reviews about they not getting the character they wanted, or things that people who never played the game can understand, so if you‚Äôve never played this game before, you‚Äôre welcome for writing a decent review that you can understand. If I could go back to the past, I would just finish the main story and stop playing.

Most of the important resources required to progress are locked behind Resin. The problem with this is that it RECHARGES SO SLOW! It takes 8 minutes to obtain 1 resin. So to get 5 resin you would need to wait 40 minutes! And that‚Äôs only a 1/4 of the resin you need to obtain anything! Second of all primogems. This is a gacha game. And primogems are essentially the material you need to do ‚Äúpulls‚Äù and use the gacha system. Mihoyo starves us on these. We get about 2 ‚Äúpulls‚Äù per 3 week event and 1/3 of a pull each day (for doing daily quests). That‚Äôs it. Sorry to go on a rant. I gave it  four stars because honestly I enjoy this game. It‚Äôs not bad by any means, but these issues are pretty big If you wanna enjoy the game long term.

Extra: If you spent money (which not many are willing to do) you can somewhat get around these problems.

Some things I do wish were implemented into this game, however, would be for character to have the ability to walk with their equipped weapon in their hands, because at this time, weapons are automatically transferred to the back of the said character once they begin walking. Another feature I REALLLY WISH for would be customized sitting animations for each character (or at least 5 star character)  it would make 5 star characters much more desirable and cool in comparison to 4 stars, and it adds to their personality.

My friend with the lowest AR (around 25) also finds the game boring, except in Co-Op. That's surprising coming from them, because they're pretty easily entertained (And very funny.) Also, primogems are too hard to get. Especially for F2P's, some people can't just dump their entire wallet into a game. As a low spender (used to be F2P, but Xiao and Herrscher of Sentience ruined it haha), it was still extremely difficult to get primogems. As for Honkai, there's many different ways to get crystals. Although the prices to pull are higher, the availability to get crystals is epic. Back to Genshin now (Not a paid advertisement, I promise), I do love the story, and characters. Xiao is my favorite. But there has to be at least SOMETHING other than the Abyss portal thingy (forgot it's name) and events to do at AR 50+ (sometimes lower!) I don't have high hopes this'll change anything, but for new players, just letting you know, treasure the fun you get from Genshin, because it probably will slow down when you get to a high AR.

If the person that has the desirable Item (say a Character) and the other person does not have a character that the other person wants, they should be able to trade in the same amount of values as the Character such as, Artifacts, Weapons, Food, Wishes, and etc. I have been thinking about this feature a lot lately and all of my friends that are also players think it would be a great feature as well. just a little suggestion :)",5,False,fueuwhhahxckocivciicicuaaliuah,suggestion,

Also never received a 5 star weapon from  any of the wishes the entire time I played. I had to forge and level up any weapons that were worth having, like the dragonspine spear, which is a ridiculous process (like the gae bolg in final fantasy 14). So disappointing. I even dropped wishes during promotional periods where the drop rate was up too. Nada. 
At a certain point you need more characters to progress and they just don‚Äôt drop. You can run the abyss for big primogem hauls but once that is done, you have to look elsewhere.

The only smooth part of it was the character picking and picking your name. Then once i finally loaded up i was surrounded with darkness, that made it really uncomfortable. 
I‚Äôll still and try to play the game and might leave another review. all i want is the mobile experience for ALL versions of the iPhone to be improved and not just the iPhone i want all the different platforms experience to improve if ey are having this same problem

Starting off, quite a few players haven‚Äôt been able to join their friends‚Äô worlds. When one requests to join their friends‚Äô world, the friend doesn‚Äôt receive a notification that someone is requesting to join their world. Secondly, when my friend joins my world, i‚Äôm suddenly not able to talk to the npcs. This is a huge hinderance since we want to do quests together! Even after my friend leaves and comes back, it still won‚Äôt work. As for me (since it‚Äôs my world), it takes me quite a few times to leave and come back to get the npcs to work again! Lastly, there should DEFINITELY be more co-op story quests available. As to my knowledge, there are no co-op story quests, which is a bit heart breaking. 

I want to enjoy having fun with my friend with not only world quests (which we rarely get to do since the npcs don‚Äôt work during co-op), but with story quests too!

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the design of the game is amazing! You really feel like you are living in a fantasy world, the music and landscape are wonderful. Though, I have been continuously having the problem of the game just not loading. I have to keep closing and reopening the app to be able to proceed, otherwise I will spend 3 minutes at a black screen with fantasy music playing. That may not sound so bad, but 75% of the time I am trying to play the game I encounter this problem. So warning to mobile users, beware of this problem and not just dive in immediately. Consider using a PC if you have one. I should also tell you that it does not just impact the amount of time it loads, but it also takes away from the amazing animation. You end up just staring at the beginning of it and hearing the scratchy noises of the narrator of that animation.

But 3 star weapons are understandable in the CHARACTER banner, but when ever I do get a pink/purple Pull or a golden pull, I almost NEVER get a 4 star or 5 star CHARACTER! So I ask of you Genshin! Please just make a update so that 5 star weapons AND MAYBE 4 star weapons MAYBE, can just stay on the WEAPON BANNER instead of interrupting the chance of getting a really cool 5 star character! So just make it so that 5 star weapons at least 5 star weapons TO STAY IN THE WEAPON BANNER, AND STAY OUT OF THE CHARACTER BANNER.

One thing I think would be coool to add to the game is to be able to do story quests again.  Like the quests you need to do to continue the story.  I think that it can work like a domain.  You do it again and you get a prize and or lose health if you finish.  I don‚Äôt think the prize should be that big considering we already did that quest.  I was thinking that it could be cool to see the cool animations from the quests again.  I know that many other players would like to experience the quests again. There could be a little slot in which we can access old quests that the player had finished.  They should also be sorted out just like the little quest thingy in the game that shows all our quests.

One thing I dislike is that characters true potentials are locked behind constellations. The only way to unlock constellations is to win that character multiple times through a gacha system, which is incredibly hard to do unless you pay a crap ton of money.

Or, you should be able to trade characters you do not want for constellation material. 
Also, I‚Äôve never been a fan of gacha systems. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating not getting what you worked / paid for. I think the rates could be a bit better.

This game is a gacha game meaning there‚Äôs a gambling element to it. For characters and weapons. Compares to other games in this category the rates for pulling characters and weapons are FAR lower than other games and the cost for pulling is twice as much as most other games. Character progression is gated behind an energy system on top of a grinding system. Most other games of this type are far more generous with their energy system.  It gets worse. You can spend hundreds trying to get a specific top tier character you want but only to realize that the character is in balanced to the point where he is out classed by mid tier characters. Once the entire players base is up in arms about this the developer responds basically with ‚Äúlol git gud‚Äù. So my advice for everyone is enjoy the game for what it is.

I‚Äôve been grinding out working on my characters and team, and I love to see their growth. Not to mention the story is very cool and keeps us busy as players.
However. In recent game play we‚Äôve seen the boss ‚ÄúChilde‚Äù get his difficulty lowered to make it more accessible for all players. Which is awesome.

2021-09-30 02:41:06,"I've played Genshin a lot, the most obvious issue is that this is possibly one of the most Grindy types of Mobile gacha games I have ever experienced, I haven't had terrible luck at all but it honestly is far too much to even get a singular summon, let alone 10 just to have a minimum chance at getting a character you like. This game almost forces you into that pay to win mindset just to be successful or get what you want. Free to play should be a lot more relaxed, so as an overall it should give out more of it's own in game currency. This brings me to the other issue, the game doesn't really have any good events or rewards, especially with the recent anniversary, it is almost empty feeling and the grind for leveling up characters is even harder, many resources often not even being able to be accessible easily, leaving you many times, more often than not, heavily under leveled.

When the 1 Year Anniversary hit, I was hopeful for some kind of fun celebration between the players and Mihoyo, that included rewards and events. Instead, I was met with disrespect and a slap to the face, followed by childlike ignorance of a major problem. The rewards were almost nothing, and the events required either essentially free advertising, or hours of work by artist for only a chance to receive anything in return. There was hardly even a celebration at all, and it truly felt as though Mihoyo spat in the face of those who have supported their game since the beginning. The way the company is treating this issue is outrageous, and I am thoroughly disappointed. Deleting negative reviews, banning accounts that speak up, shutting down the Reddit page, it is all truly disgusting behavior. In due time, I'm sure this review will be taken down as well, but I want to get my word out there, as I am a player of this game and deserve a voice.

Personally, I found myself enchanted by the game's lush landscapes and immersive gameplay, losing track of time as I embarked on quests and battled formidable foes. The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, with each character offering a unique playstyle that adds depth to the experience.

However, I have some reservations about the game's gacha system, which can feel overly reliant on luck and may tempt players to spend real money on virtual currency to obtain desired characters or items. While the game is technically free-to-play, the temptation to invest in microtransactions to enhance the gaming experience may be a turn-off for some players.

That said, despite its monetization model, Genshin Impact remains a standout title in the RPG genre, offering hours of entertainment and a sense of adventure that's hard to find elsewhere.

Don‚Äôt expect to find a legendary weapon in the woods or suddenly find a quest in a book or anything like that. The combat is fun but the effects can be overwhelming to the point where there‚Äôs nothing but chaos on the screen and you are basically just using the same maneuvers blindly. There are different weapon types but each type works the same within its category, polearm users typically use charge attacks, claymore users spin around etc. combos never really deviate from the normal attack 3 or 4 times, skill then burst, then switch charecter rinse and repeat. It has great graphics and if you love anime girls/boys you‚Äôre gonna love collecting but that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the game.",3,False,Sensei305,It‚Äôs not Elden Ring.,

But ever since the anniversary rewards incident genshin had been getting a bad wrap, I know i speak for the larger community when i say we don‚Äôt want people to lose their jobs or have other games taken down. That vocal minority are not and do not represent the larger community. Genshin is a game about exploration in the early game, then it turns into a study game where you figure out how the different systems in the game work, and then it becomes a routine. I‚Äôve loved this game since it came out and will continue to love it but if you don‚Äôt enjoy the game, or the community please don‚Äôt attack mihoyo or anyone affiliated with them. Even if genshin has some scummy money grabbing tactics avoiding those is something we‚Äôre just going to have to deal with in the world we live in.

Unfortunately, the drop off past AR50 is stark. The game is clearly designed to get you to form addictive habits and normalize casual spending, and it‚Äôs dark the way these patterns manifest. Perhaps even more importantly, the dev team has completely ignored user feedback about a wide array of bugs and issues, including auto-targeting problems, lack of constellation toggles, resin gating for time gated content, diminishing rng returns in domains, etc. I would recommend this game up until AR50, but then run far far away, before you get addicted and do something you might regret. Lastly, and just as a side note, the management team for this game is completely non-responsive to the playerbase, basically insulting us with their silence in the face of outcry about pervasive issues and insulting mechanics. Better management is needed asap. Corporate greed is ruining this game, just like everything else in this world. Where are the tech otakus to save us? Just my 2¬¢. Fingers crossed we see change soon!

As a writer, the story lore is complex and amazingly funny at times. The dialogue and voice actors in different languages all have their strengths and weaknesses. Their diversity in voice languages and text is another thing that stands out. I have played this game since its early days and I am sure I will continue to play (as a high adventure rank player) despite there being a lack of content at times since I am already up to date with most of the things in-game. Highly recommend for those who like to invest in characters and see them do big damage! I am also F2P and a lucky fellow to get the five stars I want.

I ended up loving this game so much and I‚Äôm mostly playing for the story unfolding. All the major story arcs are amazing and even quests that tie into the main story with more lore is just great. One thing that could be fixed would be the resin system. There should be a faster loading resin time, as well as having more resin in a day, or at least building up for the next day. Also, the artifact/weapon domains should be much convenient such as choosing to get which artifacts you need or at least being allowed to have a higher chance of a particular artifact. Lastly, one thing that is also quite inconvenient is that when you are doing a quest, it may become unavailable if a character in that quest or the area for that quest is also being used for a different quest.

And with all the characters and weapon upgrades there‚Äôs always something to work toward. I myself have spent a few hours fighting monsters trying to get primogems to get characters. On the subject of characters, I think the idea of a completely chance-based system to get a character makes the game a lot more fair than games that just let you pay to get them. If I have any complaints, it‚Äôs that it can be difficult to get enough primogems to do wishes.

Stealth missions are missions that require a stealth character(shifter) and you can buy a shifter for 1500 primo gems. I feel that‚Äôs a good price, or put it in a pack so people can get it with primo gems. I would love it but give a higher chance of getting a character because I rarely get any characters with wishes. I am adventurer rank 18 and I only have my base 4 and 4 other characters.

It feels like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but with magic. The story is relatively engaging and there are mechanics that make it feel like a survival game, like cooking, climbing and hunting. Some downsides I can think of are that the game is really big. Right now, it‚Äôs sitting at 7.12 GB of storage and took around half a day to download. Another downside is the rarity of the good characters. I have pulled quite a few times so far (around 30-40 times) and have gotten no characters, only items.

Not having a rerun you might as well make them a 4 star so that people can get them while you add more five stars to your game to free up space so people can have characters they want tooo! People wants to trade characters but CAN‚ÄôT I know people can get scammed and what not but I seriously suggest making old five star characters into new 4 star because if you keep adding 5 star what little or left 4 star characters people will have and it‚Äôll get boring and people quit.

The story- the story is rich in action, and the plot is very good. How it works- the instructions are very clear and the player (hopefully) understands clearly. Updates- the updates aren't just ""fixed bugs"" there us much more, it updates almost every month and the updates are very interesting (see the newest updates!)

If I had any complaint about it, it would be about the fact that after level 20 leveling up gets increasingly difficult, repetitive and time consuming. Most side quests have to be found by just walking around I would like it more if you added more features to the map like possible side quests or explorable areas for more experience points to help with leveling. I also feel like there should be more mobs it gets a little repetitive fighting the same kinds on repeat though I understand since the game is fairly new.

Honestly, the only thing I look for in a game are good graphics and design. For me, genshin is the model of that right now. Yes, I know there‚Äôs problems in the game, like any other game, and yes, I would like more endgame content, an expanded co-op feature, more resin, and a better artifact system (My suggestion is to make artifact domains similar to talent and weapon ascension domains. For example, make Emblem of Severed Fate on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday & make Shimenawa‚Äôs Reminiscence on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sundays will allow you to choose which artifact set you want. This will allow players to farm artifacts the same way since you can make condensed resin on off-days while removing a layer of RNG).

Mihoyo, even compared to other gacha games of lesser popularity and content, is a greedy company and this has been proven with the recent anniversary rewards.

I‚Äôm very active in the fandom and we were all very excited about the anniversary rewards, but mihoyo has failed our expectations. It‚Äôs been highly successful yet the most mihoyo has decided we deserve is a single ten pull. Some members of the fandom had lofty expectations such as getting a free features five star in addition to weapons and even more wishes, while other thought that the least mihoyo would do was simply give us a standard banner five star of our choice, similar to how they give a limited choice of S Rank Valkyries in some of their special events in mihoyo‚Äôs other game Honkai 3rd. This was the minimum of what I expected from mihoyo, especially since in earlier events such as the Lantern Rite event we were able to get a choice of Liyue four star while also getting a free ten pull.

The story is constantly expanding and growing and you can clear 99% of the game content without spending a single Mora‚Ä¶er, penny. New characters and world regions are being added every month or so.
Special limited time-events happen often and allow you to do things from play co-op hide and seek to battle dungeons with unique puzzles and hordes of enemies.
DEVELOPERS
My only two wishes:
-Remove the world level difference for co-op play. Or make the variance a little wider to allow higher level players to join lower level players. This would be great for people with friends just starting the game to jump in and help them level up or just enjoy playing.
-Make it easier to get materials to ascend characters from later regions unlocked during gameplay. It can stink to pull a character from Inazuma and have to wait a while to significantly ascend them. Maybe there is a garden aspect similar to the serenitea teapot but easier to access in Teyvat?

When you start out, you get a plethora of them via content. By the time you're AR 45 or so, those wells will start to dry up. So I recommend saving those and instead invest your daily resins (NOT the fragile resins, don't touch those until AR 55!) into leveling up characters, their talents, and weapons.

Zero representation for darker skin colors , or just any skin colors other than paper white. This company supports the sexualization of young children and makes promises they can‚Äôt keep.

- The ability to go into every building. While the towns are beautiful and big, I think it would be great being able to walk into houses and every business.
- Have more ways of healing. Cooking is great but maybe add an inn at each town? And also, have characters revive over time after getting defeated in battle? Or you can even add a feature where characters heal little by little whenever they sit.
- Have the npc conversations go back to where you left off prior to you selecting your reply. It‚Äôs kind of annoying having to go through all the dialogue in order to read the answer to every choice.

Like I said, the game is fun. The only real con I have is that the game overheats my phone and crashes at times. I usually have to play with my phone near a fan and plugged in to keep it cool and prevent the battery from draining. Other than that, you would not regret downloading the game!

The fact that it is a mobile game is impressive as well; it being free to try is probably the biggest reason to check it out and adds for it are not even overhyping it like other games have done with misinformation (RSL).
Performance:
The large scale environment combined with the console level gameplay is truly impressive with no graphical issues or gameplay bugs. With the ZBotW style gameplay, you can explore freely and see the nooks around the map and still with no glitches.
Visuals:
The performance could come down to the semi simplistic styles but that is also a catch of the game. It is colorful but controlled which makes everything distinct. I am a big fan of environments and atmosphere in video games and I hope to see a bit of variety. I enjoy darker tones and colors but I could still enjoy the lighting and colors.

The fighting mechanics are nearly flawless (with elemental reactions being a very big contributor to the fun). The story itself isn‚Äôt the game‚Äôs greatest strength, but it is still very fun to play through and see how everything unfolds. I am quite intrigued how everything will play out in the future; it is incredibly hard not to find spoilers all over the internet! It‚Äôs hard to believe that so much content can be found in a mobile game. My only complaint about the game is the whole ‚ÄúGacha mechanic‚Äù rewards system, which makes it incredibly difficult to get good rewards from your rolls without paying money. The pity system is a very welcome addition to this mechanic, but I think the rolls should be a bit more ‚Äúmerciful‚Äù.

I mean, a total of 60 primos a day without any events doesn‚Äôt help someone get banner character back to back especially in a 6 week span. In addition, just giving people 30k mora after a survey isn‚Äôt much of anything especially for an AR55 ranked player like myself. Now, lemme get to the crappy part which is the anniversary web event rewards. 90% chance to win 100k mora and then there‚Äôs 1,000 people who only get 100 primos. That is just like giving people the middle finger after playing your own game. Plus, the developers don‚Äôt even own up to such mistake which is not a good business move on their end.

Lack of rewards, bonuses, a pity system that is a couple steps backwards from HI3 including a worse UI, and the ever present requirement for dupes to unlock character traits lead to a very player unfriendly environment.

The biggest claim to fame here is support that extends to console (although even that is limited so much it‚Äôs almost not worth mentioning), but the hoops they had to jump through for that means that monthly logins are awkwardly through a website that has no direct connection to the game.

Overall what we have is a game that is superficially great but ultimately fails in every single aspect once you dig below the surface.

Another thing is that there isn't enough things to do in late game, and while i haven't yet tried this new permanent update gameplay thing, I feel like there probably never will be enough content for late game. Also, the updates seem to be getting even more boring as they come and I'm afraid that by the time that all 7 nations are out that it'll just be repeating what happens in the first few nations.

thought the game has a couple of downsides to it, starting with several glitches in events, the really bad rng, greedy company, and the miserable fanbase.

Breaking it down, 
the game revolves a lot around rng/luck based iteams, characters, weapons, and more, this is something most people can progress and deal with, but in late game, things like this just become frustrating and makes the game repetitive and very non-entertaining‚Äî THOUGH because of events and ongoing story quest IT IS something you can cope with,

Also, I have used money on this game‚Äî explaining this in a central way, Mihoyo is a very greedy company when it comes to Genshin, rarely do we get awards worth while, and the game truly does cater to heavy spenders, through for a casual player, I can see how this isn‚Äôt even an issue. 

One thing that‚Äôs also very frustrating is the gacha system, though, thanks to more frequent reruns, it does make things slightly better..

So far there are only 4-5 characters with tan/brownish skin colors and with the new update you would think there would be more characters with dark brownish skin tone. There aren‚Äôt. What really pisses me off about this is that the new characters are mainly passed of DARKED SKINNED PEOPLE and yet they are either whiter than paper or only have a slight tan. Also the fan art and official art aren‚Äôt any better. They both completely whitewash characters and I‚Äôm considering deleting the game because of this.

The lack of care with this region is saddening and loses a lot of the depth that comes with it in exchange for cheap orientalist takes on the life and most importantly people in these places.

Once I got navigation sorted out, I advanced to Adventurer 4 and had fun doing that, but then I got to the part where I made it to Mondstadt and was given my glider and forced into a confrontation with Stormterror.  The audio is apparently corrupted because it keeps stuttering and the screen is completely black except for a few controls.  Every now and then, I see a red arrow, and I assume Stormterror is in that direction, but I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing.  Things like this really ruin the game for me.

The intro backstory is very VERY laggy. Like I couldn't really enjoy it and no matter how many times I close out the game and reopen it to see if it'll stop the lag, it doesn't. 

The second part is the game. The entire world is literally a black void, not even joking with you. There's nothing but black void. I was heavily confused and tried accessing the game controls and couldn't find them to see if it'll fix the black screen that I'm seeing. 

Last part is that Everytime the character steps in water, (can't see the water mainly because the entire world is a black void but know it's water because it keeps saying wet) it give this bright blob of light, not letting me see the character at all and it won't go away for like half a minute.

It‚Äôs also great that you have your own world for yourself and if you want to co-op, others can join your world without affecting it and vice versa). I love the voice acting for both English and Japanese (I prefer Japanese) but the one thing that stood out to me is that when you are doing the story, sometimes the characters would address me as ‚ÄúHe‚Äù even though I was the female twin. I didn‚Äôt get too bothered by it but it just stood out. Also, as a suggestion to the creators, it would be nice if there more outfits for each character and not only two outfits in the shop.

It does not only take up 4GB of storage, as you progress it takes up wayyyyy more than the app store tells you, i am up to 15GB. Secondly, everything takes forever to load and should be made easier to log into your account and quicker download times. And another easy fix is make it easier to get primogems if your going to make it hard to pull characters that you actually want. Getting enough primogems for a 10x pull can take hours if you dont have any quests to do!

I can understand why people are upset, the first anniversary was a highly anticipated event and it fell short. The rewards were mediocre at best, and the web event only benefited a very small number of people. MiHoYo has also been censoring people by removing the signature feature in-game, and by removing posts and banning people in Discord and on HoYoLAB.

The rewards the game gives you are negligible and embarrassing when compared to other gacha games. AR rewards are nothing considering how long it takes to get AR levels after 50.

Every time you gain a rank you get a reward to help with the new difficulty. Except, the rewards are useless by the time you reach that adventure rank. They would have been useful maybe 20 ranks ago. You can only get meta characters and weapons through very low chance summons. With maybe 2-3 banners up for 6 weeks. It takes at least 50 summons for a guaranteed 5 star.

1st is paimon. There needs to be an option to completely replace or mute paimon without muting the other characters. Paimon is not a guid nor is she a good companion. The way she is used to further the plot is annoying at best. If the traveler has a voice, then WHY do we need this flying piglet to speak for us? This is not how you do the ‚Äúsilent but deadly‚Äù troupe. There‚Äôs a long list of issues I have with paimon but I will leave it here.
2nd: the lore. This game loves to shove lore down your throat at every given turn. Lore being in some story quests are fine but I play the events to get primogems, not find out about razor‚Äôs parents. This could‚Äôve been explored in his story/hangout quest. Why they felt the need to add it just as a new map launched is beyond my understanding. There‚Äôs just way too much lore and too much forcing a connection with npcs.

Not only are the graphics and characters great, but the story keeps your interest. I can‚Äôt wait to see how far this game will come along!!

Couple suggestions though!!

Is it possible to have friends on other servers? I wasn‚Äôt able to locate one of them because he was in Europe, and I was in the American server. If not, definitely should be a thing! :)

Another thing that would be really neat is romancing characters in game! Going on dates and gifting them things.

Some other suggestions would be to make talking to friends more accessible, even if we‚Äôre not in co-op, it would be nice to talk to the ones online. 

I think the co-op mode definitely needs some tweaks, but it‚Äôs getting there. It‚Äôs not the greatest game for co-op, because there‚Äôs a lack of things your friends can do with you. We should be able to do more quests with them. It would also be nice to be able to have avatar emotes in game. 

Another thing I think could need updating, is the camera option. There‚Äôs a lack of poses and features for it, as a creative person, it would be nice to be able to take more photos of my game and with my friends!

There‚Äôs a lot of quests and things to do so it can get really overwhelming but really this is just an open world game that comes out in installments. Pick a direction and go. 

Nothing lives up to hype unless it‚Äôs a game that really really meshes with you, but I would argue Genshin comes very close to being one of the best games.

As a lover of the old LoZ, FF, and the old platformers, it is its own game. Not to say it doesn‚Äôt borrow mechanics heavily, as literally MOST games do! but it also makes it its own before presenting it to you in an optional play for play or play and pay to play.

i adore the characters and story, you can clearly see a lot of thought and care put into each design, not just in the characters but in the environment as well. and the story itself just feels so big and grandiose to me, since we've barely scratched the surface of the tale being told. i'm very much looking forward to seeing how the plot plays out!

though, this game is not without issue. once you get pretty late in the game there's not a whole lot to do, you can wander around but past ~AR45 there's a good chance you've explored most of the area already. there are constant events which is great, but they're never permanent and there's only so much substance they provide. 

all in all, genshin impact is a great game, though it takes up a lot of space i'd say it's well worth it if you enjoy open world exploration and intricate storylines, and if you're willing to wait for new content to be added once you reach the end of the currently available archon quests.

Maintenance is always rewarded generously, and there are CONSTANT events going on. You seriously can't get bored of this game.
 
However, it's poorly optimized and doesn't run well on most devices, which is why I play mainly on my PC. I wish we were allowed to limit render distance so the game would run better. I also wish there were more options for customizing the settings, such as eliminating all the animated grass. I just don't enjoy how it looks personally. 

Otherwise, the gameplay is fun an innovative, they add new mechanics (such as my favorite new mechanic: fishing!) and the daily commissions are extra incentive to play daily.

The second problem is that it is super stingy and greedy right now is the anniversary event for a game that has been out for two years you would expect the game to give us a good reward, but no it gives us a single ten pull     ( you need 90 pulls to get a guaranteed 5 star character) and a trash event that I would assume takes 2-3 hours of boring story that I don‚Äôt care about.

If you don‚Äôt get what I mean let me explain. So basically, you could ask someone to duel and you bring along four characters. If the person accepts the request you will be automatically be sent to a open area to duel. After you and your opponent click ready, the game will begin.

The music, the scenery, story, gameplay and characters are amazing. I play just about every day. That being said, there are some things that could be added or improved.

1. Weekly boss battles don‚Äôt need to cost resin. They are only playable for rewards once a week and the resin they cost could be spent on other things such as artifact quests, wits, material and mora quests.

2. Resin either needs have a higher cap or a faster refill time. Both would be preferable as that would allow for more game time between updates.

3. I also think it would improve the game to have occasional quests that offer up free new four and five star characters/ unique weapons/ skins (like the quest for Barbara‚Äôs summer skin for example). Other games do this and still use the gacha system to release characters. This idea would help with the oft heard lament that game content gets finished too quickly. The interesting part of this idea is that it could be used to encourage exploration or could require players to visit multiple regions.

It plays like Breath of the Wild, in terms of exploration and item creation, but it also throws in elemental effects and statuses.

There‚Äôs a huge area to explore, even if you don‚Äôt work on story quests immediately. The only issue I‚Äôve encountered so far is that it does make my phone overheat if I play too long, and then the game crashes.

20 minutes of gameplay. It forces you to explore the world, which... understandable I guess but what‚Äôs going to be the fun in exploring the world if you‚Äôre forced to just so you can... play the game?

Genshin Impact is a fun open-world RPG with a creativity and spark like no other that can‚Äôt be replicated so simply but if you take the gameplay, it‚Äôs not all that it plays up to be.

However, I wish that there was another way to earn more primogems faster for F2P players. I understand there are daily commissions and new upcoming events that distribute some primos when you partake in them, but it is only enough for a few wish pulls.

A 5 star character is guaranteed when you reach 90 pity on a banner, and a lot of primogems are required in order to reach that number. If you have Bennett‚Äôs luck, (like me), it is really difficult to obtain new 5 star characters when you only get one every 80-90 wishes.

It would be nice if the developers can increase the amount of primogems us F2P players get so we have the opportunity to have as many new 5 stars as possible (or at least lower the guaranteed 5 star rate chance when wishing).

Other than that, the graphics are so beautiful and I love how there is little to no lag as a mobile player. Although this game does take up a lot of storage, it‚Äôs really worth it.

It's supposed to be challenging yes, but I think it might be a bit difficult for new players since their stamina wouldn't be as high as a AR. 50 player. And to get to the winery from the statue is a bit far for them. So I was wondering if you could add a teleport waypoint a bit closer to dawn winery but not exactly at it.

But I do have some genuine concerns. It isn‚Äôt MacOS friendly, the quests are originally long for veteran players and then are cut in half for new players, and if you take a break from Genshin you will miss a lot of things.

I still haven‚Äôt unlocked Enkanomiya. I was getting bored of doing the same exploring, trying to max out explorations, collecting offerings to the god of the region,  finishing off quests to unlock more new levels to explore, and a similar character design for new characters. 

It also made people who played mobile switch to pc because of the amount of storage needed. I am Ar 55 and I have been playing since last march.

As of writing this there are 52 in game characters yet only 2 of them have tan skin. And out of those 2, one happens to be a black stereotype. With the new update of sumeru and future updates i would like to see some characters with actually dark skin because of this region being based off of places with people who typically have dark skin instead of the usual white skin tone. many of the characters coming out have lighter skin than the ones from monstadt (based of germany) which is very upsetting to see. additionally theres no plus sized character except for npcs. as someone who is plus sized i hope to see a plus sized character very soon. i hope these issues gets changed soon and we happen to get more diversity.",4,False,i<3willbyers,great but..,

One problem I do have with the game is the storyline. Much of it feels emotionless, and the protagonist always wins so far, making the game feel very much like a Disney show. I think that if the developers made players more connected to them, and made it so that at one point or another, the traveler has to face something different, not just a boss battle, but maybe something more emotional, such as a character in the game dying, and not just super suddenly.

A perfect example of this is a free weapon in game called 'The Catch.' It's the best F2P weapon in the game, and it takes hours to get.

My only distaste for the function of this game is the lack of things to do while in coop. Theres really just bosses, exploration, and the card game to mess around in. And the teapot. There should be epic weekly quests to do or long raid fights. Domains are easy when you coordinate with your party. I love playing support roles in groups and my team and I just mash through domains. 

Id like too see a dungeon system in Genshin, with mini bosses and then the final boss. Story attached to each dungeon giving us a reason to be there.

Once you reach the later game stages, the gameplay stagnates. There isn‚Äôt much for returning players to do and daily quests/rewards don‚Äôt scale with your level. The game is built to give you just enough rewards to keep you playing, but never to help you succeed. Five stars are almost guaranteed to be locked behind paywalls when you reach the late game.

-loading time for cutscenes, areas, etc. can be a bit buggy and force me to restart my game..this too is frustrating since it can reset quests and interactions of characters..And even erase progress I have gotten..also some things don‚Äôt load completely in, example..Investigating a barrel and something pops out but it doesn‚Äôt appear at or it appears later..or it crashes the game, and cause more problems in playing.

The gameplay is solid, and although it incorporates more traditional gacha-style game progression, it does so in a way that isn‚Äôt too obnoxious. You can easily progress whether you spend real currency or not.

A lot of the fun for me is in the story and the gameplay. It‚Äôs surprisingly good story and character voice-overs will keep you entertained, as an RPG should.

My biggest complaint is probably that is just a bit too open world, and there aren‚Äôt too many activities to keep your interest for more than an hour or two at a time. This is a fine game to help you relax, but as a grind, it can be kind of boring.

The storyline is awesome with the Traveler being from a different world, and with the Traveler always trying to find clues as to where their lost sibling is, it spikes more excitement!

I love this game, but the more you play the more boring it kind of gets.

It takes a lot of time towards this game for any reward, to the point where it‚Äôs debatable if it‚Äôs even worth it. 

Most of the cutscenes are lackluster too, with the same 10 preset animations mixed and matched to tell a story. Presets are fine, a great way to push out content faster for the masses, but the preset animations are clunkly and super boring. Genshin needs more dynamic preset animations if it wants to tell most of its story through cutscenes. Old characters are super ugly and have snappy animations, but the creators make no effort to improve them, instead focusing on putting out newer and prettier content.

A lot of the problems with Genshin Impact are foundational, and it‚Äôs clear the company doesn‚Äôt actually care about the game but sees it as a cash cow.

The characters are all memorable and lovable, the combat is very colorful snd fun, and the story and lore are very interesting too. 

The developers will not listen to your suggestions though and will even try to censor you on their social media platforms that allow it, so don‚Äôt expect any improvements. The game will also try to milk you of every penny you‚Äôre worth with tempting mechanics such as getting resources faster, getting characters you want more often, and of course making your characters stronger which can cost you upwards of thousands in USD.

The enemies are also repetitive. It‚Äôs fun to fight a boss the first time, but it gets very annoying to fight the same boss throughout the entire game, but with a longer kill time.

Gameplay:
The story and gameplay are fun, with easy controls and mechanics that are fun to master. The story is pretty long with maybe ~10-20 hours as of now, and more story is always being released. The characters are unique and fun to use. The gacha system is a little painful as a F2P player, as it takes a significant amount of time to get the currency needed to start wishing, but since it‚Äôs a free game, it‚Äôs more or less understandable.

Visuals:
Even with all the graphic settings turned down, the game still looks very good. It has a distinct art style that flows quite well. It‚Äôs always fun playing with the hot guys and the cute waifusüò≥

Performance:

 Out of around 50 characters, there are only 2 characters that have a dark shade. And in multiple official artworks, those characters have been white washed. This problem has been around ever since the game was released, except it‚Äôs now becoming more apparent during the arrival of the new region, Sumeru.

Sumeru is a nation that is based off countries home to darker skinned citizens. You would believe that Sumeru would have dark skinned characters, but the reality is that there are only 3 slightly tan characters. It‚Äôs even more problematic when you learn that those characters are based off historical figures with much darker skinned tones. Take Candace, for example. She is based off a Nubian Queen named Kandake. Her skin tone is my color, and I am white. If you search up Kandake, you will see that she has a very dark skin tone. It is incredibly disrespectful to directly reference on historical figures, but not take the most crucial and impactful part.

The story takes too long to get through, then when you do get through it, you're stuck walking around the entire map trying to find chests or fighting the same boss for the tenth time that day to get materials to level up your character and/or weapons. (Items you can conveniently buy in the store)

The event menus get confusing because they put lock symbols over both parts that will come in a few days and parts that need a requisite mission (however if you've seen the message of ""available in 2 days"" before clicking on an event that needs a requisite mission, you often assume it's just gonna be available in a few days)

The characters started out pretty strong, you can remember them. However, newer characters? They don't feel as though they have unique personalities, they feel as though they've reskinned beloved characters hoping to get people to throw their money at the new ones too. It would be more preferable if they focused on the characters they literally don't put into the storyline (like the One black character) than releasing the 10th polearm user.

1. The stamina bar, works exactly like the Zelda games‚Äô stamina bar, and when you climb something, it‚Äôs undoubtedly similar.

2. The storyline is even similar, a person who is close to the protagonist, gets captured by this godlike being, and it‚Äôs your job to rescue that person.

3. The game has gliders, literally gliders, they function the exact way the gliders in Zelda do.

4. When you switch over to a different character, such as someone with a bow, it works the same way as in Zelda, and with a tank class, if you hold down the attack button, it will send you spinning as a special attack, and eats up your stamina, oh, and guess what? It works the same way as Zelda.

5. The enemies? They almost aren‚Äôt even retextured, they just all look the same as the enemies from Zelda.

6. The game, is fun, and has an engaging storyline nevertheless, but it only has so little unique features to not get a lawsuit from Nintendo. Overall, fun game, but a little sus on the original side.

Inazuma has a mysterious, dangerous but beautiful scenery that is also full of culture. Sumeru is packed with nature and it gives off a youthful lively feeling.

Not only that it takes forever for resin to regenerate.

Now I personally think and so do other people too....
This game is full with potential to come by how it already looks there is no doubt this game is a successor, really gives of a different vibe and controls to the game, finding stuff , actually having to read what the NPC say, to get to point A and point B.

Time to get to the point of why I wrote a Review of this game Pets! without a doubt the game should have pets.. following every where u go... like that one dog at washi inn (the big tree with the broken stairs inn don‚Äôt really know the name) that follows you inside or outside the inn..
Pets would honestly be nice in the game and having to feed them when they attack the monsters for u and there health goes down.

1. No controller support at the moment. This would solve SOOOO many control issues I have with the game.
2. Enemies regenerate life when returning to camp. Sounds ok right? Well not if you happen to cross the threshold that their dog chain allows them quite frequently. You could be battling a harder enemy only to be flung out of it‚Äôs reach and lose interest in you, making you lose your progress in the battle.
3. Climbing and gliding controls are odd. This could be in part to the camera angle, but the controls themselves are finicky. Sometimes I jump off of something and expect to glide only to tumble to the ground. Sometimes I want to climb something to escape but the character won‚Äôt even grab onto the thing I am trying to climb. This could possibly be fixed with future controller support added.

At first this game is enjoyable but once you get to Adventure Rank 40+ and done everything it is all about maxing out and grinding till you drop game.

End game materials will take you YEARS to complete because 1 character might take 6months to max out even if you‚Äôre the luckiest gamer in RnG history (materials are so rare and RnG + can only be farmed once a WEEK).

Gacha rates are sooo LOW that the developers refused to show the drop rate and made it to 50pulls guarantee which sounds good to many but really it‚Äôs just saying that mandatory 50pulls for your S hero so whale if you want 7 of them to max out or to even be viable to end game bosses.

Also you need many good different heroes to play because of elemental properties for different enemies. The free heroes are trash and boring.

Hero progression is one thing to worry about but wait there‚Äôs more!! you got artifacts with RnG base stats, what about weapons? well Yeah! you need good weapons too!.  So grind till you‚Äôre wallet is empty or grind till you say it quits.

If you are to create a region that is based off of the Middle East and parts of Africa, then make the characters reflect that. Pale/tan are not the only skin tone in these regions and, if anything, darker skin tones ARE MORE COMMON in these areas. There is no reason that some non-African people are DARKER than these African inspired characters. 

The lore, the culture, the music, everything else that has been released for sumeru has been wonderful. It seems to capture the culture that Sumeru is inspired by wonderfully. But the character designs do not match that. You cannot go around and use REAL PEOPLES culture for profit and then turn around and NOT INCLUDE THEM in your game.

As an eager enthusiast eager to delve into the world of Teyvat, the insurmountable storage requirements of Genshin Impact have been a formidable barrier to entry. Despite my anticipation to experience the game's immersive gameplay and captivating storyline, the sheer size of the game has rendered my device inadequate for the task.

Frustratingly, before even embarking on the adventure, I find myself locked out due to insufficient storage space. It's disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to join the millions of players exploring the vast landscapes and engaging in epic battles within Genshin Impact's enchanting universe.

The inability to even download the game highlights a significant issue faced by many potential players who are constrained by limited storage capacities on their devices. It's a missed opportunity not only for players but also for the game's developers, who may be inadvertently alienating a portion of their audience due to this storage dilemma.

In essence, the towering storage requirements of Genshin Impact not only pose a hindrance to current players but also deny aspiring adventurers like myself the chance to partake in the excitement and wonder of this celebrated game.

The whole system it built to make you spend money but once you finally get to the end game there is nothing. The events are repetitive it‚Äôs either fight the same enemies over and over or fight a boss you have already beaten multiple times. The story question are filled with unnecessary dialogue and grinding relics is just beat the same dungeon over and over again. You will almost certainly not get what you want from relic farming and when you do it‚Äôs not that rewarding because there is literally not end game.

And now, apparently, there‚Äôs a way for hackers to get your name from your linked social media accounts (especially Facebook) very easily as long as they know your password.

The community‚Äôs been trying to push for 2FA because security is important. Imagine spending a hundred or so on an account and that it can easily be hacked through brute force.

As someone who has played Honkai Star Rail since its release, I've seen a huge difference in the way players are treated. And with the release of 4.4 and it's underwhelming rewards, this only worsens. But that doesn't mean giving me ""better rewards"" just this once will fix this. It didn't last time, it won't this time. Scraps won't be enough to keep this under the table. Clearly nothing was learned and we were just given very little to shut us up. It feels upsetting and disrespectful. Not to mention the upsetting rewards we have gotten in the past for getting Genshin Game of the Year awards not just once but TWICE and for multiple categories.
All of this compared to Honkai Star Rails rewards this last GOTY event.

More in-depth issues I have seen/experienced:
ÔªøÔªøÔªøMore endgame content doesn't mean more challenging content, just something else to do on a weekly basis to let veteran plavers do something.
ÔªøÔªøÔªøBetter rewards, it shouldn't take 3 patches to guarantee a 5 star (if you lose 50/50) when there's 4, soon to be 6, featured banners every single patch.

characters! each are their own individual they have their good side and their flaws. they seem so real, and not fake. i can relate to some of the characters or feel empathy towards them

cons;

not enough to do in the later games; what i mean is that in the emd game there‚Äôs nothing much to do but help farm comm abyss events. it‚Äôs just so repetitive, and as a genshin player we get burnout. leading us to stop play for weeks or months.

event rewards;
there‚Äôs not a lot of them, i believe the lanternrite only gave us around 680 primogems (dont take my word for it!). it is barely enough to do a 10 roll. it‚Äôs a major issue since there‚Äôs not a lot to do to get primogems especially for end game players. unless you buy them yourself.",4,False,tufusuu,mediocre,

and another note, the wishing system is horrible. if youve played this game you know how frustrating it is to wish. for those that dont know, its most definitely not free to play. you have a 50% chance of getting the limited 5* on the banner within the first 90 wishes but if you lose to a standard character, then you will get that limited 5* character guaranteed. so if you have bad luck, you will get that limited character within 180 wishes. primogems that can be converted to wishes are really time consuming to farm for bc they dont give that much primos in events or rewards. and considering my luck, ive wished on 10 different character banners and i lost on half of them, thus most of them were guaranteed.",2,False,someoneThatWannaMarryThisGame,nice lore but racist company + wishing system,

2021-01-16 02:26:01,"The first few hours are nice. There are some very well done mechanics and it is a very good open world for a mobile game.
Then the gacha gets you.
At higher levels every aspect of the game forces you towards spending money.
At Adventure Level 45, there is maybe 20 minutes of content a day, while loot is meager. 
The resin system limits all aspects of player and gear improvement. Spending money or not playing are the only options. Spending a LOT of money. 
You are forced to only level a character or two at a time because it will take months to level all of them, or you can spend money.
Rolling for characters is deceptive. To actually get all of the features, you must successfully roll for a specific character 7 times (6 for the free ones). A couple recent characters were not great until you rolled them a couple times.

I also think that hovering or flying should be a thing (with only the twin characters) because just having wings as a glider with them is useless (in my opinion) flying should be activated like when you glide you just double tap the jump button any time and the characters will begin hovering and you take off to start flying.,5,False,lil Jay Bean,A few things,

2023-03-12 14:11:37,"Game was a lot of fun but the direction of their design is poor now. They will create a problem and then ‚Äúsell‚Äù you the solution. 

A lot of their new characters are designed around potentially being viable in the future (cyno and dehya) instead of with current content. Using in game currency or real money hoping something might be usable in the future is bad and developers shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded for such poor design.

Likewise, a great number of character base kits are balanced around the user having multiple copies (constellations) to boost their base kit. This makes having the base kit clunky and not user friendly. This was not really seen in the older units and is a newer trend to encourage people to spend real money.

Overall, the game was fun when the company could take user feedback and admit they messed up (like with Zhongli) but with new characters such as Faruzan and Dehya they have ignored the community and have deliberately given these characters (products) clunky and poorly designed kits that require months of in game saving or hundreds of dollars to ‚Äúfix.‚Äù

1) darker skinned characters other than sumeru npcs, xinyan, and kaeya. yes i looked at sumeru leaks and honestly they are gonna happen but darker skinned characters need to be made (more than just in sumeru) i'm really hoping the following nations have more darker skinned characters.

2) more traveler lore. the only reason why i'm continuing playing this game is because of the lore and we NEED more traveler backstory other than ""oh yeah they are rocks and have a blanket and stuff"" i understand the other characters are important but come on, the traveler needs better lore

3) lgbt representation. it won't hurt you and idc about laws you did it in honkai do it in genshin 

4) standard banner fixes. the standard banner needs more 5* characters and the same fix that you did with the weapon banner. 

5) More albedo appearances. i just wanna see him in more nations along with klee üòì

6) the sixth thing is just LISTEN TO THE FANBASE when we say we want more rep or rewards listen to us.

7) better rewards for upcoming anniversary. i'm not expecting much but i hope you all at the hq or whatever learned from last year's anniversary.

One of them is the accession rank things. (the one that you have too beat a bunch of things too get a world rank thing or whatever it‚Äôs called, sorry I‚Äôm bad at explaining) they seem pretty easy at the start but then you get to the electro thing & it gets really hard. I still can‚Äôt beat it & I have some pretty good people. The second thing is when a hilicurcil falls off a Cliff that could kill it, it will respawn, which is kind of annoying.

I‚Äôm not a whale mind you( someone who spends lots of money) but the fandom has been extremely toxic as of recently, from arguing about how a character is black or not to anniversary rewards, it is probably one of the most toxic fan bases of recent years, and that‚Äôs saying something.

The game is intriguing and addicting and there‚Äôs so many different ways to play. 

However, it‚Äôs a Gacha game and that can be rather difficult at times, you‚Äôre not always lucky. But there is a system in place to make sure it‚Äôs decently fair. You can win characters for free but it‚Äôs easier if you‚Äôre willing to spend money.

At the ending part once you grab all of the pearls from each small island in the region (watasumi island) you go to this place and you have to break all the seal. But once you get to the last one it doesn‚Äôt spawn your hydro monsters and you have to move one of each of the statues. And I don‚Äôt know if you noticed but that‚Äôs super annoying especially when the last seal is extremely hard to survive. After you fix it it‚Äôll let you move one of the statues from that seal and it works but if you die again you have to move one from each all over again. I want this bug fixed since it involves the upcoming update and it will be hard for players to enjoy the new quests without being frustrated.

2021-09-29 00:05:46,"Great game! I enjoy playing this game and love using the gacha ü§ó! what bothers me is not the storage -because that‚Äôs reasonable, but the actual devs. they‚Äôre so harsh on the amount of currency (in this case it‚Äôs primogems) they‚Äôre handing out. I know that it would ruin the gameplay and the game would just fall apart if all our resources are given for free but cut some slack. on the anniversary we got less than a single pull, no wishes at all.
I‚Äôve been a player for quite some time now and I‚Äôve seen that some amounts are eh, but when I saw the anniversary reward i was kind of just concerned. But since that was a while ago and is not something for newer or other players to worry about anymore, I‚Äôll just rate the game.

I think this game is so detailed and the quality- depending on what platform you‚Äôre using , is absolutely gorgeous! everything has an amazing amount of detail, and every character has a story!

I hope whoever reads this knows that you won‚Äôt be fully satisfied and rather just stick to your old game. Also the anniversary event was utter trash!!! They could‚Äôve given players 10 to 20 wishes but they decided to only give them 40 primogems the equivalent to doing one mission. One of the worst if not the worst things this game could‚Äôve ever done to their day one players. I hope they listen to their audience and fix their mistakes before it‚Äôs too late.
